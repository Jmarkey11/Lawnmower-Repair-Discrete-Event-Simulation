# Lawnmower Repair Discrete Event Simulation

## Overview

This project is an event simulation that involves a factory production line for building lawnmowers to order. The simulation focuses on the main bottleneck in the processâ€”attaching the blades to the motor using a single machine that frequently breaks down. The simulation models key aspects of the system, such as order arrivals, construction times, and machine breakdowns, to evaluate how disruptions affect production. 

The following research questions will be addressed:  
- RQ1: How much production time is lost due to machine repairs?  
- RQ2: How many lawnmowers experience interruptions in their construction because of breakdowns?  
- RQ3: How long do orders wait before completion, and how much would wait times improve with a more reliable machine?  

The model will incorporate exponential and deterministic distributions for order arrivals, construction times, and machine breakdowns. Results from the simulation will help the factory owner assess the impact of purchasing a new machine with fewer breakdowns, focusing on improvements in efficiency and reductions in waiting times.
